# onthemapTouchID
The app uses a map that shows information posted by other users.
The map will contain pins that show the location where other users have reported working. 
By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the user finds interesting. 
The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.
